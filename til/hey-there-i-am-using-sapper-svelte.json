{"html":"<p>When I built this site in 2018 I wanted to learn something new, so I used <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">NextJS</a>, a ReactJS framework to build Server Side Rendered and Static Sites — which is pretty fun to work with.</p>\n<p>Honestly, rewriting it to Sapper was something I didn't need to do. But as I wanted to add the <a href=\"/til\">TIL</a> section to the page, I thought: Ok, why not? Let's learn something new. </p>\n<p>So this is the site audit with Lighthouse with the NextJS build: </p>\n<p><img src=\"/posts/improve-site/performance-next.webp\" alt=\"performance-next\" /></p>\n<p>So now the turn for Sapper. The steps I did are dead simple: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go straight to the <a href=\"https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs\">Sapper Docs</a></li>\n<li>Clone the starter template</li>\n<li>Migrate the React components to Sapper with the same styles</li>\n<li>…Boom</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/posts/improve-site/performance-sapper.webp\" alt=\"performance-next\" /></p>\n<p>This is straight from the template using the exported build (static generated html files, no server side needed).<br />\nIt takes 150kB space to download the main page. Funny thing, 45kB are just the fonts from <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/\">Google Fonts</a>, and 17kB the Favicon. I guess I'll need to cut the size off on that small icon soon…</p>\n<p>The same stuff with NextJS takes up to 300kB, doubling the space. It may not look like much more space—a 1 hour movie in any streaming service can be more than 1 GB—but after reading for a while, I am getting more and more concern of how we waste the resources in the digital world, and how we can adapt the so-called ecological digital design. For instance, there's this French Studio called <a href=\"https://fairness.coop/\">Fairness.coop</a> (in French) which is aiming to develop all of their products in the most sustainable way, so the have the less ecological impact possible. </p>\n<p>Coming back to the topic, to be really fair with NextJS: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>I am using a pretty outdated version.</li>\n<li>I didn't pay too much attention on optimizing the code.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I guess the build size and performance can be really boosted to the same level as the Sapper one using a proper version and taking time into optimizations. </p>","metadata":{"title":"Hey there, I am using Sapper (Svelte)","summary":"How I improved the performance and size of this site using Svelte","date":"2020-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":"sapper, svelte, javascript, software, ecosoftware","slug":"hey-there-i-am-using-sapper-svelte"},"filename":"improve-site-performance-sapper.md","path":"/Users/torrealj/Dev/personal/alextorres.me/src/posts/improve-site-performance-sapper.md"}
