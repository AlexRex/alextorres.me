The last project I was working in adidas was GMR (_gamer_).

This project was such an amazing experience. We worked together with Google and EA in a product which tried to connect the physical experiences playing football (_soccer_) with the gamming environment of FIFA. 

In essence there's a tag (based on the [Jacquard](https://atap.google.com/jacquard/) technology) developed by Google. This tag is capable of counting a series of metrics from football players: counting kicks, kick speed, distance travelled, etc. This metrics are predicted using a Maching Learning model **inside** the tag.

In adidas we had two main tasks:

1. We had to collect data to train the model develop by Google. In order to do this we built a platform that enables sport scientists to label videos of sessions and package those sessions. 

1. We were the middleware between the Jacquard tag and EA (FIFA). We had to apply some data processing to the metrics before the reach FIFA. 

Both of this were made using cutting-edge technology.
